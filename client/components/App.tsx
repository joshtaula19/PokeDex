// Giovanni if you see this i've left comments under the components:
// Home.tsx, PokedexList.tsx and PokemonData.tsx in case your confused about whats going on

// Josh since were both working on the css, you can see what i've done so far by using 'npm dev run' to see the home component
// If you want to alter the PokedexList.tsx file then you would have to comment out the <Home /> above and import the <PokedexList /> instead and change it back when your done
// each comp has its own css file, and i've left comments under it all :))
